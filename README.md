# 🚀 **Node.js Mini Projects**

## 📌 Overview  
This repository is a collection of my **Node.js mini-projects** built for learning and practicing **backend web development**. Each project is stored in a separate subfolder and serves as a reference for others who want to learn Node.js.  

Currently, the repository contains:  
- **📚 Book Directory Management (Ongoing)** – A backend project for managing books, authors, and users.  
- More projects coming soon!  

The goal of this repository is to create **educational material** and encourage **community contributions** to improve and expand these projects.
